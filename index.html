    <h2>Favorite Quotes</h2>
    <blockquote>
      I'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes,
       I am out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you
       can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best.
     </blockquote>
     <blockquote>
       You've gotta dance like there's nobody watching,
        Sing like there's nobody listening,
        And live like it's heaven on earth.
      </blockquote>
